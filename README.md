##Huddle
Huddle is a group travel planning app for long-distance friends. It generates the cheapest destinations for all individuals based on their different cities and budgets, provides activity search, real-time drag-and-drop “Idea Board” and scheduler for group collaboration, and produces an interactive map showing daily routes based on activity selection. This is a problem being faced by the millennials today. They need to put in a lot of effort in order to plan their meetups. What we are trying to solve is a one stop solution where they get recommendations on different destinations, activities and attractions that would not only help them with the planning but also to track their itinerary on an easy to manage webpage.
